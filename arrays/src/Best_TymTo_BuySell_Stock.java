/**
 * Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 *
 * Given an array of stock prices where the index represents the day,
 * you are allowed to buy once and sell once.
 * Your task is to find the maximum profit you can achieve.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy at price 1 and sell at price 6 â†’ Profit = 6 - 1 = 5
